## Description

"SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python."

SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

## History


[sympy/sympy: History](https://github.com/sympy/sympy#brief-history)


"SymPy was started by Ondřej Čertík in 2005, he wrote some code during the summer, then he wrote some more code during the summer 2006. In February 2007, Fabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fixed many things, contributed documentation and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz Paprocki, Brian Jorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz and Chris Wu) improved SymPy incredibly during the summer 2007 as part of the Google Summer of Code. Pearu Peterson joined the development during the summer 2007 and he has made SymPy much more competitive by rewriting the core from scratch, that has made it from 10x to 100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos has contributed pretty printing and other patches. Fredrik Johansson has written mpmath and contributed a lot of patches."
